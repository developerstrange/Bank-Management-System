# Bank-Management-System

This is my first project using *Java, **Swing, and **MySQL*.  
I built this project by following a YouTube tutorial. As a beginner, I focused on understanding the basic structure and functionality of a bank management system.

I didn’t add any custom features — just aimed to build and learn from it as it was presented. I am still learning, and hope so in the near future I will be able to build my own.

## Features of my project
- Create a new account
- Deposit and withdraw money
- Watch the mini statement
- GUI using Java Swing
- Data storage with MySQL

## Tools & Technologies
- Java
- Swing (GUI)
- MySQL
- IntelIJ

## Credits

- Special thanks to the original author for sharing the tutorial
